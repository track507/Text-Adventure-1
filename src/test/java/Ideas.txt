what if we add a puzzle and it goes like this:
(you are walking and you come across a shady looking door with a puzzle on it, and it reads:

"I'm a maze without an end in sight,
With corners hidden, left and right.
Each turn you take, a mirror shows,
Where one path starts, the other goes.
Every step you take seems the same,
In this labyrinth, whatâ€™s my name?

What am I?"

and the answer to the puzzle would be: "a twisty little passages all alike."

I am still making the scenarion for going down the straight path

describeScene();

 public static void describeScene() {
        System.out.println("You look round and find a rusted old sword mounted upon a gravestone in a distance");
        System.out.println("Do you (draw sword and fight/ hide)");
        System.out.println("You draw the weapon from the gravestone and prepare to face the unkown.");
        System.out.println(
                "Out of the darkness, a pack of feral creatures emerges, their glowing eyes fixed on you.");
        System.out.println("Do you fight or run? (fight/run)");
    }
