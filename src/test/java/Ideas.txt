what if we add a puzzle and it goes like this:
(you are walking and you come across a shady looking door with a puzzle on it, and it reads:

"I'm a maze without an end in sight,
With corners hidden, left and right.
Each turn you take, a mirror shows,
Where one path starts, the other goes.
Every step you take seems the same,
In this labyrinth, whatâ€™s my name?

What am I?"

and the answer to the puzzle would be: "a twisty little passages all alike."
