# Inception Deck
1. **Why are we here?**
   - This is a quick reminder about why we are here, who our customers are, and why we decided to do this project in the first place.

2. **Elevator Pitch.**
   - [If we had thirty seconds and two sentences to describe our project, what would we say?](<../Education/Elevator Pitch>)

3. **Product Box.**
   - If we were flipping through a magazine and we saw an advertisement for our product or service, what would it say, and, more importantly, would we buy it?

4. **NOT list.**
   - It’s pretty clear what we want to do on this project. Let’s be even clearer and show what we are not doing.

5. **Meet your neighbors.**
   - Our project community is always bigger than we think. Why don’t we invite them over for coffee and introduce ourselves?

6. **Show the solution.**
   - Let’s draw the high-level blueprints of the technical architecture to make sure we are all thinking of the same thing.

7. **Ask what keeps us up at night.**
   - Some of the things that happen on projects are downright scary. But talking about them, and what we can do to avoid them, can make them less scary.

8. **Size it up.**
   - Is this thing a three-, six-, or nine-month project?

9. **What’s going to give.**
   - Projects have levers like time, scope, budget, and quality. What’s most and least important for this project at this time?

10. **What is it going to take?**
    - How long is it going to take? How much will it cost? And what kind of team are we going to need to pull this off?
